# Csrbox
This repository contains python scripts to verify the generated [CSR module](https://csrbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of the chromite core developed by [InCore Semiconductors](https://incoresemi.com/).
The [CSRBOX](https://csrbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an external python tool which can generate a bsv CSR module based on the specification provided.

More information about CSRs in RISC-V can be found here: [RISC-V ISA MANUAL](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-privileged-v1.10.pdf)

To generate the assembly test list from the python scripts, use the [UATG tool](https://uatg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html). Follow the steps given [here](https://uatg.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html).
